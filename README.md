# leetcode
Tracking my (somewhat) daily LeetCode grind, organized by topic and difficulty.

Each topic has a quick tips file and folders for easy, medium, and hard problems.

Each problem has:
  (1) its description 
  (2) my solution 
  (3) unit tests
  (4) runtime and space complexity analysis
  (5) a brief explanation of the intuition (how I got to that solution -- if i feel like it).

If anyone actually finds this then feel free to suggest any changes.
